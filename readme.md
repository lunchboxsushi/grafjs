# graph.js

Is a small light weight library using vanilla js and is meant to be extremely light weight to do the simple task, graphing.

It will be using HTML5 canvas and aims to maintain a responsive canvas structure with the key goal to be universal and usable in other frameworks as a plugin & play.

a minor goal is to create a fluid 60fps experience for using this tool while also keeping the learning curve to this library very minimal.

my goal is to provide a high level api for simple cases to create an instant mapping, my other goal is to allow a simple interface to extend the underlying calculations while having the rendering engine do its job.

* this engine will be used in my next project [future url to be here]
